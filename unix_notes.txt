Git directories
  working directory
  staging area
  Repository itself

  . files are normally hidden unless using -a flag after ls.

  git saves changes between two points/versions rather than a unique full file every time.  this saves disk space and helps git operate more efficiently

  Head always points to the place where you are currently at. 

  git branch. * indicates your current branch.

git checkout master or git checkout (x) branch.

git remotes are a way to connect to a remote repository that more than one person can connect to.

git push -u origin master
-u is so you don't have to type "origin master" in future pushes. you can just type "git push"

in real life you would do all changes on branches and then pull and merge those to master
